# My IMDB

**My IMDB** is a college project which I had to solve as a homework. Using Gradle, Java and Jackson, I've created a simple but useful program to contain a database of movies, actors and users.

# About the implementation

It took a lot of time: more than <b>*60 hours*</b> and more than 6200 lines of code to finish it.

## How to run the program

You have to run the main from the IMDB class.

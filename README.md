# My IMDB

**My IMDB** is a college project which I had to solve as a homework. Using Gradle, Java and Jackson, I've created a simple but useful program to contain a database of movies, actors and users.

# Requirments:

You needs Java 17+ to run it.

## How to run the program.
After you download the zip, make sure you unzip it in a folder with its contentes.
For both Windows and Ubuntu open a terminal and type to run it:

```bash
  java -jar "<path-to-the-file>/IMDB.jar>"
```

## How to run the source code.

You have to replace all the paths from the GUI classes where it says "./assets/remaining-path" with "./src/main/java/Assets/remaining-path" to run on any IDE.
<br>
After you can run the main function from the IMDB class in "src/main/java/org/example/IMDB".
<br>
If you want to hear the song I've made, you have to copy the song from the zip installation file (./assets/song/My_Brick_Breaker_OST.wav <- made by me) and to put it in "./src/main/java/Assets/song".
